# AutomaTikZ
## Summary
AutomaTikZ is a tool designed for the LaTeX document preparation system that allows users to generate figures of finite automata automatically from regular expressions. AutomaTikZ uses [Grail](http://www.csit.upei.ca/~ccampeanu/Grail/) to process the regular expression and [TikZ](https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf) to generate the figure.

## Prerequisites
To use AutomaTikZ, you must have the Grail software package available on your computer at `/usr/local/bin`. The currently-supported version of Grail is 3.4.4.

You can download Grail from the [Theory of Computing Software Server](http://grail.smcs.upei.ca) hosted at the University of Prince Edward Island.
